This post will show you how to set up a  GitHub Page website.

## Start new repo

Before you can start a  GitHub Page site, you need a GitHub repository! A quick way to start one is by going to github, signing in, and clicking the `+` button.

## Choose a theme

GitHub Pages has a number of inbuilt themes supported. Have a look through them and click `Select theme` on your favourite.

## Commit changes to README

GitHub automagically rewrote that README file! It's now a quick reference for Markdown with a few useful links. Don't open them through that boring page though...

## Go to your new site!

Wondering how to deploy your page now? Don't bother, githubs done it already! Go find your URL back in the settings tab of the repo.
