This post will show you how to set up a  GitHub Page website. You will need:

* A computer
* A web browser
* An internet connection
* A GitHub account

## Start new repo

Before you can start a  GitHub Page site, you need a GitHub repository! A quick way to start one is by going to github, signing in, and clicking the `+` button.

## Configure repo

The next window will provide you with some options. Fill in the relevant fields and make sure there is a README. It will be really useful in just a few seconds!

## Choose a theme

GitHub Pages has a number of inbuilt themes supported. Have a look through them and click `Select theme` on your favourite.

## Commit changes to README

GitHub automagically rewrote that README file! It's now a quick reference for Markdown with a few useful links. Don't open them through that boring page though...

## Go to your new site!

Wondering how to deploy your page now? Don't bother, GitHub has done it already! Go find your URL back in the settings tab of the repo.

## Read your README

Grats, you have a pretty new page! Use these nicely formatted links to learn about Markdown, Jekyll and your repo Settings tab.
